build me a service that offers similar functionality as pastebin.  This should offer both an api and a UI.  The service should be written in java springboot and use a database backend.  The UI can be vaadin flow or react.  Include documentation and tests.  The docs should explain the architecture, how to build and run it and how to use the apis.  Include example python and curl scripts on how to use the apis.  Include also docker and kubernetes resources.
